## TimeSeries
Finial Project in NTUST
Data we used in this project is from Kaggle and it include Timestamp,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume_(BTC),Volume_(Currency),Weighted_Price all about Bitcoin.
Finial Project 
We used five way to predict the Weighted_Price.
  1.ARIMA
  2.Prophet
  3.LSTM
  4.ARIMA+RNN
  5.ARIMA+LSTM
According to research we found, we decided to combine the ARIMA & RNN andARIMA & LSTM. Also,we used other exogenous features to increase the accuracy.
We decline almost 75% of RMSE comparing to previous version in Prophet.
